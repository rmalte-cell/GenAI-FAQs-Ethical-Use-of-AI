    <p>"You are organizing your wedding, the documentation team is asking 40k for the wedding package. 
      They will use an Iphone 16 pro max to cover the event and CapCut for the same day edit video. 
      The documentation team has 2 years of experience and has an above average portfolio. 
      Would you agree to that deal? Explain your answer and justify the integrity of their work. 
      Reflect on the integrity, creativity, skill level of the “vibe” coders."</h1>

    <p><b>My Analogy</b></p>

    <div style="flex: 1; text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">
    <p>In my perspective for their organization, I'm wholeheartedly agree for taking a low budget rather than having a high-end professional cameras and editing suites, in which it isn't absolutely prohibited to use for the event all along. 
      However the golden rule for that it should must be honest of using AI in limitations and maintain their transparency to deliver the outstanding quality.</p>

    <p>For that case, using the Iphone 16 pro max and Capcut is the most eligible tools that able to capture the fantastic scenario in video edit and portfolio featuring our unforgettable memories. By containing their ability of being professional reliability, 
      demonstrating genuine effort, using tools effectively and transparently, problem-solving, adaptability or self-improvement and emotional creativity to express themselves how good they are actually even with a mediocre experience and adjusting the knowledge of editing. 
      Somehow for vibe coders, they are also assisting the team at times with interesting suggestion if their idea got running out and feeling exhausted to finish the work. But I really understand the huge flaws of vide coders that they can’t guarantee correctness and also can’t 
      solve some unexpected problems without AI for the code. Because of that, they often hide behind AI-generated output, in which they could only paste prompts from internet and produce code that looks right but breaks in production. It seemly useless and unfair for the team but 
      the most important they could take the lead to overcome it. And I hope our wedding will be successful and interesting than nothing at all.</p>
    
    <p>In the conclusion, I'm expectingly praise and motivate their architectural output and it shouldn't immediately rush to conclude their effort. Even the vibe coders, they should be also aware the inaccuracies and error due to their low integrity and creativity until the team will take their responsibility respectfully.
      By being honest to use the tools effectively in purpose way such as problem-solving, adaptability, hard-wroking and also how to manage it personally leading the experience of knowledge to maintain the quality and transparency.

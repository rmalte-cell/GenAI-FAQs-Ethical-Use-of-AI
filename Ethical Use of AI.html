    <p>Use of GenAI where it enhances and adds value to the intended learning outcomes of a module, and/or the student learning experience – GenAI tools have the potential to help students collate large quantities of information while practicing their critical skills in assessing GenAI outputs. 
      In addition, there is growing research about how we can use GenAI to personalise learning, either through supporting staff to develop personalised learning resources or by acting as a study tutor for students. They should not, however, be used to replace learning or intended learning outcomes</p>
    
    <p>It will be transparent, including declarations in student assessment, staff-generated learning materials and adherence to referencing guidelines. Both staff and students must be transparent about when and how they have used GenAI as part of their work. As well as learning potential, 
      GenAI tools can also enhance the learning design process, improving feedback writing and creating efficiencies in busy workloads. Staff should model the transparency that we expect of students in their use.

    <p><b>Avoiding plagiarism and misuse</b></p>

    <div style="flex: 1; text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">
    <p>Plagiarism is defined as the act of using someone else's work or ideas without giving proper credit or attribution.  Since AI chatbots and other generative AI tools generate new text and images in response to prompts, using material from generative AI could be considered more like ghost writing than plagiarism.  
      The use of generative AI for coursework, if not sanctioned by the instructor, would be considered cheating whether or not it was considered plagiarism.Some scholars have proposed modifying the definition of plagiarism to focus less on the concept of theft and more on the intentional or careless lack of acknowledging one's sources.
      This new way of thinking of plagiarism would incorporate ghost writing, including text generated by AI, and the use paper mills and text spinners.

    <p><b>Accuracy and verification of AI outputs</b></p>

    <div style="flex: 1; text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">
    <p>The credibility and accuracy of AI-generated content are paramount in assessing AI technologies’ reliability. Mishra’s research on the ethical implication of AI in libraries displays the multifaceted challenges posed by AI-generated content, including concerns about bias, privacy, and job displacement (Mishra, 2023). 
      Godlewski’s exploration of best practices for first-time AI users underscores the importance of setting clear goals, designing precise prompts, and rigorously reviewing and editing AI-generated outputs to ensure accuracy and relevance. These studies offer valuable insights into how complex AI-generated content is and how important it is to fact-check its outputs to check for accuracy and credibility. 
      Godlewski explained, “As AI cannot pull from real-time online information, checking the results for credibility and potential plagiarism is vital” (Godlewski, 2023). Through careful analysis and consideration of such research findings, stakeholders can better understand the nuances of AI technologies and implement strategies to enhance the reliability of AI-generated content.</p>

    <p>“Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of AI-generated content necessitates robust verification methods,” emphasized by the AIContentfy team’s article on quality control for AI-generated content. The article underscores the importance of verifying facts, statistics, and claims against multiple trustworthy references to avoid spreading misinformation. According to the article, implementing fact-checking tolls, 
      third-party verification services, and monitoring the AI’s performance are crucial to ensuring accuracy and reliability. Additionally, the article suggests cross-referencing information from multiple reliable sources and checking for biases and misleading content to uphold the integrity of the AI content (AIC, 2023). It also highlights the significance of maintaining ethical standards, avoiding plagiarism and copyright infringement, 
      ensuring consent and privacy compliance, and monitoring and addressing bias and discrimination of AI content. Gurnsee also mentions in his article “Elaborating AI Output” that to properly analyze an output from AI, you should ask yourself the date, authority, purpose, and documentation of said output (Gurnsee, 2024). By incorporating human review, utilizing subject matter experts, and applying user feedback for academic improvement, stakeholders can enhance the trustworthiness and credibility of AI content.</p>

    <p><b>Bias and fairness</b></p>

    <div style="flex: 1; text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">
    <p>Bias in AI happens when the outcomes it produces are unfair or skewed due to problems in the data it learns from or how it is programmed. This can occur if the training data doesn’t include a wide range of perspectives, if the system is poorly designed, or if societal inequalities are baked into the data. For example, in education, bias could show up as grading systems that favor students from specific backgrounds, admissions decisions that unintentionally exclude certain groups, or learning tools that work better for some demographics than others. 
      These biases can lead to unfair treatment and missed opportunities for students, making it essential to evaluate and address potential biases when using AI carefully.</p>
    
    <p>AI systems are only as good as the data they are trained on. If the data reflects biased or incomplete information, the AI will learn and perpetuate those biases. This can lead to unfair outcomes—such as biased grading systems, unequal access to educational resources, or reinforcing stereotypes about certain groups of students. For example, if an AI system is trained predominantly on data from one demographic group, it might not perform as well for students from other backgrounds. 
      This is why it’s important to critically assess and regularly audit AI systems to ensure they are fair and equitable for everyone, regardless of race, gender, or socioeconomic status.</p>

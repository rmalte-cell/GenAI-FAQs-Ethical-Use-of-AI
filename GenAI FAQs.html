    <p><b>What is Generative AI?</b></p>

    <div style="flex: 1; text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">
    <p>Also known as Gen AI, is the type of artificial intelligence that can produce quality content for various purposes such as conversation, images, videos, music or software code through response of user's request. And it can usually learn about human language, programming languages, art, chemistry, 
      biology and any subject matter in process of machine learning models that simulate the critical thinking, problem solving, and decision-making processes of the human life. By identifying and encoding the patterns of code and relationships in huge amounts of information to acknowledge it and understand users' natural language questions.

    <p><b>How does it work?</b></p>

    <div style="flex: 1; text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">
    <p>Generative AI have three phases to operate it:</p>
    <ul>
    <b>1. Training</b>
    <p>It originates with a foundation model that serves as the basis for using the different types of multiple gen AI applications such as large language models (LLMs), featuring with multimodal foundation models that will creates several kinds content generation.</p>

    <b>2. Tuning</b>
    <p>It must be adjusted the foundation model to a specific content generation task in a various way:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Fine Tunning</b></li>
    <p>It contains feeding the model labeled data specific to the content generation application questions or prompts the application is possibly to secure and corresponding accurate answers in the desired format.</p>

    <li><b>Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)</b></li>
    <p>Human users respond their request to generated content with evaluations the model can use to update the model for greater accuracy or relevance.</p>
    </ul>

    <b>3. Generation, evaluation and returning</b>
    <p>The developers and users must continuously assess the gen AI application's program and maintaining optimization of its engine quality and accuracy. And Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is the another option of a framework for extending the foundation model to use relevant sources outside of the training data to supplement and refine the parameters or representations in the original model.

    <div style="flex: 1; text-align: justify; padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px; font-size: 25px;"></div>
    <p><b>What are its limitations or risks?</b></p>

    <div style="flex: 1; text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">
    <p>The limitations or risks of using Gen AI that challenges to the developers, users and the public areas how to manages the most serious issues to addressed are:</p>

    <p><b>Hallucinations’ and other inaccurate outputs</b></p>
    <p>It is a generative AI output that contains nonsensical or altogether inaccurate but, all too often, seems entirely plausible. The classic example is when a lawyer used a gen AI tool for research in preparation for a high-profile case and it produced several example cases, complete details, but they were entirely fictional and hoax.</p>
    
    <p><b>Inconsistent outputs</b></p>
    <p>Due to the variational or probabilistic nature of gen AI models, the same inputs can result in slightly or significantly different outputs. This can be uncomfortable in certain applications, such as customer service chatbots, where consistent outputs are expected or desired. Through prompt engineering iteratively refining or compounding prompts, users can arrive at prompts that consistently deliver the results they want from their generative AI applications.</p>
    
    <p><b>Bias</b></p>
    <p>Generative models may learn societal biases and inaccuracies present in the every data sources, or human evaluators used to tune the model and generate biased, unfair or offensive content as a result. To prevent biased outputs from their models, developers must ensure diverse training data, establish guidelines for preventing bias during training and tuning, and continually evaluate model outputs for bias as well as accuracy.</p>
    
    <p><b>Lack of explainability and metrics</b></p>
    <p>Many generative AI models are ‘black box’ models, meaning it can be challenging or impossible to understand their decision-making processes; even the engineers or data scientists who create the underlying algorithm can understand or explain what exactly is happening inside it and how it arrives at a specific result. Explainable AI practices and techniques can help practitioners and users understand and trust the processes and outputs of generative models.</p>
    
    <p><b>Threats to security, privacy and intellectual property</b></p>
    <p>Generative AI models can be exploited to generate convincing phishing emails, fake identities or other malicious content that can fool users into taking actions that compromise security and data privacy. Developers and users need to be careful that data put into the model (during tuning, or as part of a prompt) doesn’t expose their own intellectual property (IP) 
    or any information protected as IP by other organizations. And they need to monitor outputs for new content that exposes their own IP or violates others' IP protections.</p>
    
    <p><b>Deepfakes</b></p>
    <p>Deepfakes are AI-generated or AI-manipulated images, video or audio created to convince people that they’re seeing, watching or hearing someone do or say something they never did or said. They are among the most chilling examples of how the power of generative AI can be applied with malicious intent.</p>

    <p><b>Any other FAQs you want to add.</b></p>

    <div style="flex: 1; text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">
    <p><b>What is a large language model?</b></p>
    <p>A large language model, or LLM, uses mathematical principles to understand the relationship between words and sentences. It can predict what words might come next in a sentence based on prior training data.</p>
    
    <p><b>What is generative AI? How is it different from regular AI?</b></p>
    <p>Generative AI, or GenAI, refers to a subset of AI that uses prompts to analyze data, detect patterns, and then create new or original content, like text, images, or even computer code.</p>

    <p><b>What is prompt engineering, and how does it enable GenAI?</b></p>
    <p>A prompt is the starting point for generating AI responses. Simply put, a prompt is just a way of telling the AI what task you want it to perform, like asking it a question or giving it an instruction. The more precise and specific you are with your prompt, the better the AI can understand what you need and give you the correct answer or result. The term "prompt engineering" is about creating clear and useful instructions— or prompts — so the GenAI knows what you want it to do.</p>

    <p><b>What are some of the applications for GenAI in day-to-day business operations?</b></p>
    <p>GenAI can help us innovate by creating fresh content, discovering trends and extracting insights from data, summarizing information efficiently, and automating solutions and processes.</p>
    
    <p><b>What are some of the ethical concerns surrounding GenAI? </b></p>
    <p>Concerns about GenAI revolve around several key areas:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Accuracy:</b> GenAI is known to hallucinate by providing inaccurate, misleading or incomplete information.</li>
      <li><b>Bias:</b> GenAI tools have the potential to perpetuate biases present in the data they are trained on, exacerbating existing inequities.</li>
      <li><b>Digital divide:</b> GenAI may widen the gap between those who have access to AI tools and resources and those who don't.</li>
      <li><b>Ethics:</b> GenAI-generated content can make it difficult to determine who created a piece of work.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>What are some privacy and security surrounding GenAI? </b>
    <p>When using AI, you should err on the side of caution when it comes to what you input with a generative AI platform. Also, consider disabling options related to saved history to prevent the information from being logged or tracked for training model purposes. Avoid inputting any sensitive data, such as Moderate or High Risk Data, whether using a personal or Stanford account with a third-party AI platform or tool that is not covered by a Stanford Business Associates Agreement. Review Stanford approved services by data risk classification.</p>
